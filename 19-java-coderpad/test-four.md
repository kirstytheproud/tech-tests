Pool Area

The swimming company has asked you to write an application that calculates the volume of cuboid shaped pools

Write a class with the name Rectangle.  The class needs two fields (instance variable) with the name width and length both of the type double.

The class needs to have one constructor with parameters width and length both of type double and it needs to initialise the fields.

In case the width parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0.

In case the length parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the length field value to 0.

Write the following methods (instance methods):

Method named getWidth without any parameters, it needs to return the value of width field.
Method named getLength without any parameters, it needs to return the value of length field.
Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated area (width * length).


 Write a class with the name Cuboid that extends Rectangle class.  The class needs one field  (instance variable) with name height of type double.

The class needs to have one constructor with three parameters width, length and height all of type double.  It needs to call the parent constructor and initialise a height field.

In case the height parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the height field value to 0.
