# _Nology Tech-tests
This is a collection of Junior Software Developer tech tests. The aim is to give you exposure to a wide variety of technical assessments. Each Test is from previous student so they are real world examples of what you might get. Take each test with a pinch of salt e.g. you could use react instead of angular etc.

### Tech Test Topics to be clear on

- TDD - What is it? How have you used it? Why is it relevant?
- GIT - Why is it useful in a project? What is git flow? What benefits does gitflow/branching provide?
- OOP - Understand OOP concepts, Class v Object? Interface v Inheritance? Solid Principles vs OOP Pillars?
- Agile - **Requirements Gathering**, Review, Retrospective, Planning, Estimates... Not just WHAT they are, but WHY are they useful? 

... but overall, let them know your thought process. Break down problems with them if you're stuck/unsure. Don't go silent
